Features for a Cloud Native World

* Other languages before Golang: overly complex.

Issues
1. Low Program Comprehenisibility: Cleverness over clarity was becoming common.
2. Slow build times: Language construction and years of feature creep.
3. Inefficiency: Dynamic languages trading efficiency and type safety for expressiveness.
4. High cost of updates: Incompatibility b/w even minor versions of a language.

Fast Builds
* Slower builds => Loose out on developer productivity.
* Not aware of the compiler details.
* Not complex relationships b/w files, simplifies the dependency analysis.
* Reduces the overhead due to C-style include files and libraries.
* Possible cons => some promising Go features getting skipped due to affecting the build times.
