**Fan-In**
* Multiplexes multiple input channel onto one output channel.
* Services that have multiple workers that all generate output may find it useful to combine all of the workers' output to be processed in a single unified stream.

**Implementation**
* Implemented by Funnel function. It can receive any no. of channels as input.
* For each channel it starts a separate goroutine to read values, so that they can be read parallely.
* All the values are written to the output channel.
* The wait group is marked done when all the values from an input channel are written to an output channel.
* We also run another goroutine in parallel which will wait for all goroutine to be done using wg.Wait and close the output channel so that nothing more can be read from the output channel.

**Fan-Out** 
* Fan-Out evenly distributes messages from an input channel to multiple output channels.
* Useful for parallelizing CPU and I/O utilization.
* Split will accept a source channel and the desired no. of destination channels.
* Forwarding logic can be done in 2 ways:
    * Single goroutine that reads from Source and forwards them to Destinations in a round-robin fashion. It has the advantage of requiring only one master goroutine but if the next channel isn't ready to read yet, it will slow down the entire process.
    * Using separate goroutine for each destination. It requires slightly more resources but is less likely to get bogged down by a single slow running worker.
