// Go Routines
// When func main() is called, a go routine is automatically created.
// go ==> Run this function inside of a brand new go routine
// As soon as it sees some blocking code, control flow is passed back to
// the main routine to check if there is any other go routine waiting for execution.

// All these go routines are handled by the go scheduler.
