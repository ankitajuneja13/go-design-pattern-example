// Body io.ReadCloser
// This show that struct can also have interfaces as types
// This means that we can have any type that satisfies the io.ReadCloser interface.

// So we figure out that ReadCloser is also a type
// type ReadCloser interface {
// 	Reader
// 	Closer
// }
// This is not the normal interface syntax that we have seen
// Probably an interface could have multiple interfaces that must be satisfied
// So, ReadCloser interface must satisfy the requirements of both Reader & Closer.
