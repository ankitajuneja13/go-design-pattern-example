* Aim is to have a set of objects that are already created at compilation time but which can clone as many
times you want at runtime.
* Eg. default template in web pages / default pricing plan.
* Difference b/w this and builder ==> Objects are cloned for the user instead of building them at run time.
* You can also build a cache-like solution.

Objective
* Maintain a set of objects that will be cloned to create new instances.
* Free CPU of complex object initialization to take more memory resources.

Acceptance Criteria
1. To have a shirt-cloner interface to ask for different types of shirts.
2. The new instance(clone) created must be different from the original one.
3. SKU of the created objected shouldn't affect new object creation.
4. An info method must give all the information available on the instance fields,
including the updated SKU.
