* It wraps an object to hide some of its characteristics.
* These characteristics could be the fact like it is a remote object(remote proxy),
a very big image or the dump of a terabyte database(virtual proxy), or a restricted 
access object(protection proxy).


Objectives:
* Hide an object behind a proxy so that features can be hidden, restricted and so on.
* Provide a new abstraction layer that can be easy to work with and can be changed easily.

Proxying around actions:
* We also wrap proxies around types that need some intermediate actions like giving
authorization to a user, and providing access to DB, cache before DB.
