Suggests creating a mediator object to avoid direct dependencies between objects.
Example: Railway platform
* Two trains never communicate among themselves on the availability of the train.
* The station manager acts as a mediator & makes the platform available to only one of
the trains.
* It maintains a queue of waiting trains. In case of a train leaving the platform
it notifies one of the train to arrive next.

* passenger train and goods train implement the train interface
* station manager implements the mediator interface.
